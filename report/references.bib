        Detecting cosmic gamma rays at high rates is the key to time-resolve
        the acceleration of particles within some of the most powerful events
        in the universe. Time-resolving the emission of gamma rays from merging
        celestial bodies, apparently random bursts of gamma rays, recurring
        novas in binary systems, flaring jets from active galactic nuclei,
        clocking pulsars, and many more became a critical contribution to
        astronomy. For good timing on account of high rates, we would ideally
        collect the naturally more abundant, low energetic gamma rays in the
        domain of one giga electronvolt in large areas. Satellites detect low
        energetic gamma rays but only in small collecting areas. Cherenkov
        telescopes have large collecting areas but can only detect the rare,
        high energetic gamma rays. To detect gamma rays with lower energies,
        Cherenkov-telescopes need to increase in precision and size. But when
        we push the concept of the -far/tele- seeing Cherenkov telescope
        accordingly, the telescope's physical limits show more clearly. The
        narrower depth-of-field of larger mirrors, the aberrations of mirrors,
        and the deformations of mirrors and mechanics all blur the telescope's
        image. To overcome these limits, we propose to record the -full/plenum-
        Cherenkov-light field of an atmospheric shower, i.e. recording the
        directions and impacts of each individual Cherenkov photon
        simultaneously, with a novel class of instrument. This novel Cherenkov
        plenoscope can turn a narrow depth-of-field into the perception of
        depth, can compensate aberrations, and can tolerate deformations. We
        design a Cherenkov plenoscope to explore timing by detecting low
        energetic gamma rays in large areas.
